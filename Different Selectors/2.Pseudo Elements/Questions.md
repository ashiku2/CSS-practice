# What is a pseudo class in CSS?

CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:) after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or "active", like this: (a:hover). A pseudo-class is used to define an element's particular status. It can, for example, be used to: when a user hovers their mouse over an element, it is styled. Visited an unvisited links should be styled differently. When an element receives a lot of attention, it's time to style it.

Only one pseudo-element is allowed per selection, and it must come after the series of simple selectors that represent the selector's subjects. Note that in a future version of this standard, several pseudo-elements per selector may be allowed.
